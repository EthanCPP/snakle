# Snakle

This is Snakle. The unexpected, but not totally unwelcome, marriage between Wordle and the classic game Snake.

### Important notice

This game was created in about 2 hours. If you plan on learning from this project, my best advice is **don't.** It's a pile of crap but it does the job. That being said, if you want to fork this and make it your own absolutely go for it - and let me know what you end up building!
